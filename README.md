## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that guides you through training and evaluating a VGG16-based neural network for Arabic sign language gesture recognition. The model architecture is implemented from scratch (not using pretrained weights), covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.


## Features

* VGG16 architecture built from scratch without pretrained weights
* Supports training from scratch or with fine-tuning options
* Includes image preprocessing and augmentation pipelines
* Provides evaluation metrics and visualizations of results

  

## Dataset

The project assumes the use of an image dataset containing various Arabic sign language gestures. Please ensure your dataset is structured appropriately (e.g., one folder per sign/class).

**Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints. You may use public datasets or your own custom data.

## Model Architecture

- **Base Model:** VGG16 (Unfreezed)
- **Transfer Learning:** Optionally fine-tune top layers
- **Classification Layer:** Custom dense layers added for sign language class prediction

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaraElwatany/Arabic-Sign-Language-Detection-Using-VGG16.git
   cd Arabic-Sign-Language-Detection-Using-VGG16
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**
   Make sure you have Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook installed. Install dependencies via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   - Organize your dataset in a directory structure suitable for image classification.
   - Update the dataset path in the notebook as needed.

4. **Run the Notebook**
   - Open the notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook arabic_sign_language_vgg16_scratch.ipynb
     ```
   - Follow the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

## Results

You can expect to see accuracy metrics, loss plots, and confusion matrices after training. Modify the notebook to save or visualize additional results as desired.
